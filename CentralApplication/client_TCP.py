"""
client_TCP.py
This script is a simple TCP client that connects to a server running on a Pico W board.
It sends messages to the server and prints any messages received from the server.
To use this script, replace the server_ip and server_port variables with the IP address
and port of the Pico W server you want to connect to. Then run the script using Python 3.
Example:
    python client_TCP.py
Dependencies:
- Requires Python 3.x.
- No external libraries are needed beyond the standard library.
Note:
- This script is intended to be used with the server_TCP.py script running on a Pico W board.
- The server_ip and server_port variables should be set to the IP address and port of the server.
- The client will connect to the server and send messages entered by the user in the command prompt.
- Messages received from the server will be printed to the console.
- Don't try to run this script on WSL, use a native Windows or Linux environment.
