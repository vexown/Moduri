# Build.sh
#
# Description:
# This script automates the process of building a project using CMake.
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Checks if the 'build' directory exists and creates it if not.
# 2. Configures the build directory by running CMake.
# 3. Builds the project using CMake.
# 4. Prompts the user to press 'X' or 'x' to exit the script.
#
# Usage:
# Run this script from the root directory of the project. It assumes that
# CMake is installed and available in the system PATH.
#
# ****************************************************************************

# Exit immediately if any command fails
set -e

# If a command in a pipeline fails, the whole pipeline fails
set -o pipefail

# Run CMake to configure the build system
# This command generates the necessary build files in the 'build' directory.
# These files include:
# - Makefiles or project files for the chosen build system (e.g., Make, Ninja, Visual Studio).
# - Configuration files that define how the project should be built.
# - Dependency files that track which files need to be recompiled when changes are made.
cmake ..

# Build the project using the generated build files
# This command compiles the project based on the configuration done by the previous cmake command.
# It uses the generated Makefiles or project files to compile the source code into executables or libraries.
