 * Function: tcp_client_recv_callback
 * 
 * Description: 
 *      This callback function is called automatically when data arrives 
 *      at the TCP client. It handles the incoming data by storing it in 
 *      the client's buffer, prints the received data (for testing), and 
 *      sends an acknowledgment back to the server. Look for TCP_EVENT_RECV
 *      in the lwIP TCP code/documentation for more info on how this callback
 *      is used.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *  - void *arg: Additional argument passed to the callback, configured
 *               via tcp_arg() for the given PCB. In this case, it is the
 *               pointer to the TCP_Client_t structure (not really used rn).
 *  - struct tcp_pcb *tpcb: Pointer to the TCP protocol control block 
 *                          associated with the connection that received the data.
 *  - struct pbuf *rcv_data: Pointer to the pbuf structure containing the 
 *                           received data (or NULL if the connection is closed).
 *  - err_t err: As of today's state of lwIP, this is always ERR_OK (0)
 * 
 * Returns: 
 *  - err_t: For TCP receive callbacks (tcp_recv_fn), you should almost always return `ERR_OK` (0) 
 *           which indicates normal processing. This tells lwIP you've handled the data correctly 
 *           (by copying it, processing it, or discarding it) and want the connection to continue. 
 *           You must properly free the pbuf with `pbuf_free()` before returning, unless you're storing 
 *           it for later use (rare). The only exception is when you've called `tcp_abort()` within your 
 *           callback to forcibly terminate the connection - in that specific case, return `ERR_ABRT`.

                    * - If the receiver STOPS acknowledging data (by not calling tcp_recved()), the sender's
                    *   usable window gradually shrinks to zero as more unacknowledged data arrives
                    * - Once the window reaches zero, TCP protocol prohibits the sender from transmitting ANY
                    *   more data (except "window probe" packets)
                    * - This creates a complete pause in data transmission - a "zero window condition"
                    * 
                    * Implementation:
                    * - When buffer occupancy exceeds threshold -> we stop calling tcp_recved()
                    * - This naturally leads to a zero window as more data arrives
                    * - Once flow_throttled=true, we maintain zero window until buffer is processed
                    * 
                    * Recovery:
                    * - When buffer drops below threshold -> we call tcp_recved() with available space
                    * - This reopens the window and allows sender to resume transmission
                    * - See tcp_client_process_recv_message() for recovery logic
                    *
                    * Advantages: Simple to implement, very effective at stopping transmission
                    * Disadvantages: Binary on/off control rather than gradual slowdown

 *  - err_t: An error code indicating the success (ERR_OK) or failure
